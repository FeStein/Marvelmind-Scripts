# Marvelmind Scripts

This Repo contains some scripts which may be useful to work with the Marvelmind
system. I mainly wrote these for our lab at university (winter 2020/2021) in
order to plot some positions and calibrate the system.

It is important to note, that this is no complete software package but a
collection of scripts personally tailored towards my needs. Most of the labeling
of Plots is done in German because we keep our lab report in German. However, i
try to keep variables and comments in English so you should be able to follow
along and use the scripts for yourself without much effort.

Feel free to send Pull requests or fork the repo and add your own scripts to
this repo. Like this we can make a collection for Marvelmind specific scripts
since it is hard to find informations through thousands of mails and unlabeled
forum entries.
